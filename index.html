            For those who want details for some reason. This is more or less a collection of everything which has been
            asked for to date.

            In 1989, while working at at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, Tim
            Berners-Lee proposed a global hypertext project, to be known as the World Wide Web. Based on the earlier
            "Enquire" work, it was designed to allow people to work together by combining their knowledge in a web of
            hypertext documents. He wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd", and the first client, "WorldWideWeb"
            a what-you-see-is-what-you-get hypertext browser/editor which ran in the NeXTStep environment. This work was
            started in October 1990, and the program "WorldWideWeb" first made available within CERN in December, and on
            the Internet at large in the summer of 1991.

            Through 1991 and 1993, Tim continued working on the design of the Web, coordinating feedback from users
            across the Internet. His initial specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined and discussed in larger
            circles as the Web technology spread.

            Tim Berners-Lee graduated from the Queen's College at Oxford University, England, 1976. Whilst there he
            built his first computer with a soldering iron, TTL gates, an M6800 processor and an old television.

            He spent two years with Plessey Telecommunications Ltd (Poole, Dorset, UK) a major UK Telecom equipment
            manufacturer, working on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology.

            In 1978 Tim left Plessey to join D.G Nash Ltd (Ferndown, Dorset, UK), where he wrote among other things
            typesetting software for intelligent printers, and a multitasking operating system.

            A year and a half spent as an independent consultant included a six month stint (Jun-Dec 1980) as consultant
            software engineer at CERN. Whilst there, he wrote for his own private use his first program for storing
            information including using random associations. Named "Enquire" and never published, this program formed
            the conceptual basis for the future development of the World Wide Web.

            From 1981 until 1984, Tim worked at John Poole's Image Computer Systems Ltd, with technical design
            responsibility. Work here included real time control firmware, graphics and communications software, and a
            generic macro language. In 1984, he took up a fellowship at CERN, to work on distributed real-time systems
            for scientific data acquisition and system control. Among other things, he worked on FASTBUS system software
            and designed a heterogeneous remote procedure call system.

            In 1994, Tim founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the then Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) which
            merged with the Artificial Intelligence Lab in 2003 to become the Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Since that time he has
            served as the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium a Web standards organization which develops
            interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full
            potential. The Consortium has host sites located at MIT, at ERCIM in Europe, and at Keio University in Japan
            as well as Offices around the world.

            In 1999, he became the first holder of 3Com Founders chair at MIT. In 2008 he was named 3COM Founders
            Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering, with a joint appointment in the Department of
            Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at CSAIL where he also leads the Decentralized Information Group
            (DIG). Co-Chaired by Dr. Lalana Kagal, the DIG Research Group works on projects including: how to
            re-decentralize the Web and help radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true
            data ownership; working to ensure the rights of users in big data and analytics and systems; as well as
            harnessing mobile technologies to aid during disaster relief and help society.
            The Decentralized Information Group, works on the Solid Project to give people control of their own data and
            to re-decentralize the Web. He is the co-founder and CTO of inrupt, the company launched to ensure the
            success of the Solid platform and its open source community, and to build the ecosystem that supports it.

            In 2016, Sir Tim joined the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford as a Professor.

            In 2009 he founded and became Director of the World Wide Web Foundation. The Web Foundation is a non-profit
            organisation devoted to achieving a world in which all people can use the Web to communicate, collaborate
            and innovate freely. The Web Foundation works to fund and coordinate efforts to defend the Open Web and
            further its potential to benefit humanity.

            In June 2009 then Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that he would work with the UK Government to help
            make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.
            Sir Tim was a member of The Public Sector Transparency Board tasked to drive forward the UK Government's
            transparency agenda. He has promoted open government data globally, and was a member of the UK's
            Transparency Board.

            In 2011 he was named to the Board of Trustees of the Ford Foundation, a globally oriented private foundation
            with the mission of advancing human welfare. He is President of the UK's Open Data Institute which he
            founded with Sir Nigel Shadbolt in 2012 to catalyse open data for economic, environmental, and social value.
            He is the author, with Mark Fischetti, of the 1999 book "Weaving the Web" on the the past present and future
            of the Web.
            On March 18 2013, Sir Tim, along with Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn, Louis Pouzin and Marc Andreesen, was awarded
            the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering for "ground-breaking innovation in engineering that has been of
            global benefit to humanity."

            On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing Prize for inventing the World Wide Web, the first
            web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Turing Prize,
            called the "Nobel Prize of Computing" is considered one of the most prestigious awards in Computer Science.
